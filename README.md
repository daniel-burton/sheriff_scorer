# sheriff_scorer
Calculates final scores for the game Sheriff of Nottingham. Practice for object-oriented programming, sorting with keys.

In this game, players attempt to sneak goods and contraband past the "sheriff." The player with the most
gold at the end of the game wins. Each good type is worth a different amount of gold, and there are also bonuses given to the
top two players for each good type.

This program creates score objects for each player, and then accepts scores for each category. It then calculates and allocates
the bonuses and total scores, and declares the winner.

The user can then request a score breakdown for each player and view that player's score.
